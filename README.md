## 🧪 Experiment Overview

### 📖 About This Experiment

This experiment serves as the capstone of the UCSB Physics 20L laboratory series. We implemented lasers and a variety of modern physics instrumentation to revisit one of the most historically significant experiments in physics—the Michelson–Morley experiment. Though not “classical” in the Newtonian sense, this classic experiment profoundly shaped the development of modern physics.

The original Michelson–Morley experiment aimed to detect the presence of a medium called "aether," which was believed to carry light waves just as air carries sound. Its famous null result suggested that the speed of light is invariant, regardless of the direction of motion of the observer or the light source. This deeply influenced Albert Einstein, who interpreted the outcome not as a failure, but as evidence that the constancy of the speed of light is a fundamental property of space and time itself.

Theoretical physicist Hendrik Lorentz had proposed modifications to Galilean transformations to account for the null result. These ideas later inspired Einstein to propose special relativity, a theory that replaced Newtonian notions of absolute space and time with a unified spacetime framework in which the speed of light is constant for all observers.


### Modern Implementation of the 1887 Classic

# 👏 Acknowledgement 🎉

Huge thanks to Katherine Kudla, Katie!!! Thank you for your teaching, guidance, and encouragement! There were several moments when I seriously considered giving up—frustration and a "can't-do attitude" overwhelmed my mind.
But I’m truly grateful for your genuine willingness to listen and offer thoughtful advice whenever I brought up new ideas and directions throughout this lab series capstone experiment.

And also huge thank you to Sam Bonkowsky! Thanks for teaching me how to use keithley oscillascope and soldering circuits! It's a miracle that I didn't break them.

Last but not the least, "Katie, please gimme an A!!!" (🥺🥺🥺)
